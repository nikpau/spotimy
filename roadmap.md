# Roadmap

## Report

A report is collection of information calculated from a list of tracks. These tracks can either be your recently played tracks, or all that you have liked.

- Tracks By Artist
  - Top 10/20/50 by count of tracks, in which they feature
  - Distribution of artists by count; how many artists have five tracks or less, between 5 and 10, etc.
- Tracks By BPM
  - Extrema & Mean
  - Cumulative distribution

When looking at the recently played tracks, the report contains more information because we also have the time at which they were played.

- Track ranking
  - top of a period (day, week, month)
- Tracks By BPM
  - history over a period (timeline)

## Output
